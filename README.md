# Iris-Flower-Classification
In this project we predict the species of flowers based on the length of their petals and sepals using linear regression and binary classification metrics.

The provided Python code loads the iris dataset, which contains measurements of the length and width of the petals and sepals of three different species of flowers. The code first splits the dataset into features and target variable, where the features are the length of the petals and sepals, and the target variable is the species of the flower. The target variable has three classes, which are encoded as categorical labels.

The code then uses linear regression, a common classification algorithm, to train a model on the features and target variable. The model is then used to make predictions on a testing set.

Finally, the code evaluates the performance of the model using scikit metrics, such as mean squared error and r2-score. The mse measures how close a regression line is to a set of data points, while the r2-score is a measure that provides information about the goodness of fit of a model. In the context of regression it is a statistical measure of how well the regression line approximates the actual data.
